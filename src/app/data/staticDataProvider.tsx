export const ABOUT_INTRO = `As a Software engineer, I always aim higher and seek more knowledge. Beyond development there is also a passion for Cyber Security. (Secure) Software development will always be my main priority as an IT professional. Regarding my work, I'm currently employed as a Software Engineer at Komerční banka (Société Générale) where I work with KB's tech stack but mainly Java 17/21, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL and many others. 
I like to build discipline by challenging myself, therefore I spend my free time preparing for endurance races and competitive hackathons.
If it's not obvious already, I'm a very active person. When I'm not grinding my skills up, I am probably just enjoying my time in nature. I am a big fan of running, cycling and paragliding.`
