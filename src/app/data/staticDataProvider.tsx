export const ABOUT_INTRO = `I’m Lukáš Soukup, a dedicated Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Java and Spring Boot, currently shaping digital banking solutions at Komerční banka (Société Générale). My focus is building secure, scalable, and maintainable software where performance, resilience, and quality are key.

With 7+ years of experience with Java and little over 3 years of professional work in the industry, I have a deep understanding of backend systems, distributed architecture, event-driven design, and DevOps practices. I also work on full-stack projects and enjoy exploring areas like cybersecurity, AI integration, and 3D prototyping.

Driven by discipline and curiosity, I regularly take part in endurance races and hackathons—seeking growth through challenge, both professionally and personally.`
